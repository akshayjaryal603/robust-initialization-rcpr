# robust-initialization-rcpr
Using pnp to get head pose and project to initial shape, we use c++ code in this part, please refer to EPNP method or opencv.
We provide calculated pose correlated initial shapes and the code about computing texture correlated initial shape.
We use the RCPR source code, please refer to http://www.vision.caltech.edu/xpburgos/ICCV13/
